Style file for Tufte-style notes in LaTeX, intended for Live-TeXing during a lecture. The main body of the text roughly corresponds to the actual content of the lecture, and margin notes are used to write down questions about the lecture, comments, intuitive descriptions of technical definitions, etc. These two parallel tracks of discussion mirror my preferred style of math pedagogy, with alternating technical and intuitive discussions.

Use `\[...\]` rather than `$$...$$` to get the black square in the right place at the end of the proof (this is the only convincing reason to do this that I've ever read).
