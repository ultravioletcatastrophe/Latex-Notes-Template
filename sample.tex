\section{Tutorial}
\subsection{Basics}

Here is where lecture content goes, generally a summary or transcription of what is being said or written. Here is a theorem:
\begin{theorem}[Kontsevich]
    The number $N_d$ of rational plane curves of degree $d$ passing through $3d-1$ points in general position is given recursively by $$N_d = \sum_{d_A + d_B = d} N_{d_A} N_{d_B} d_A^2 d_B\left(d_B\binom{3d-4}{3d_A -2} - d_A \binom{3d-4}{3d_A-1}\right)$$
\end{theorem}
\marginnote{Here is a margin note: I use these generally to annotate my own thoughts or questions during lecture.

You can have multi-paragraph margin notes, which are configured to not have indented paragraphs.}

The above result, is, of course, thoroughly unrelated to the following fact:
\begin{lemma}
    In a $k$-free graph on $n$ vertices, there are at most $\binom{k-1}{r} (\frac{n}{k-1})^r$ $r$-cliques.
\end{lemma}
Setting $r=2$ in the above, we recover the following result:
\begin{corollary}[Turan's Theorem][hereyouputthetagforreferences]
    In a $k$-free graph on $n$ vertices, there are at most $\frac{k-2}{k-1} \frac{n^2}{2}$ edges. 
\end{corollary}
You can insert a hyperlinked reference for any theorem box if you add a reference tag (see the \LaTeX\ code at Corollary~\ref{cor:hereyouputthetagforreferences} for formatting, and see the style file for the reference prefixes for each theorem style).
\begin{proof}
    There is also a proof environment; the proof heading is configured to live in the left margin.
\end{proof}

Citations live in the right margin\cite{hartshorne}, but will not work correctly if placed inside a theorem box. The available theorem boxes are \texttt{theorem}, \texttt{lemma}, \texttt{corollary}, \texttt{proposition}, \texttt{definition}, \texttt{example}, \texttt{remark}, \texttt{question}, \texttt{exercise}, and \texttt{conjecture}. Unnnumbered versions of all the theorem boxes exist:
\begin{proposition*}[Hurwitz]
    The group of orientation-preserving conformal automorphisms of a compact Riemann surface of genus $g > 1$ has order at most $84(g-1)$.
\end{proposition*}
\marginnote{References do not work for unnumbered theorems.}

\subsection{Advanced}
\marginnote{Theorem box numbering is not affected by subsection; this is set by \texttt{secnumdepth} at the top of the preamble.}
Using \texttt{https://q.uiver.app/} (whose style file is included in our style file for convenience), we can curve arrows more flexibly in commutative diagrams than \texttt{tikz-cd} normally allows:
\[\begin{tikzcd}
    & {\PP^n \setminus \{Q\}} & {W_0} \\
    X & {\PP^n \setminus V} & {W_0\setminus V'} & W
    \arrow["{\varphi_0}", from=1-2, to=1-3]
    \arrow[from=2-2, to=1-2]
    \arrow["{\varphi_0|_{\PP^n \setminus V}}", from=2-2, to=2-3]
    \arrow["{\varphi'}", from=2-3, to=2-4]
    \arrow[hook, from=2-1, to=1-2]
    \arrow[hook, from=2-1, to=2-2]
    \arrow[hook, from=2-3, to=1-3]
    \arrow["\varphi"', curve={height=12pt}, from=2-1, to=2-4]
\end{tikzcd}\]

Finally, there is (in addition to the default environments provided by \texttt{tufte-book}) a two-column environment, which I mostly use to spam examples after a big theorem:
\begin{twocol}
\begin{example}
    In $\CC \PP^2$ with its canonical orientation as a complex manifold, we have $H^2 = H_2 = \ZZ$. Lines $L$ in $\CC \PP^2$ are embedded copies of $\CC \PP^1 = S^2$, with a single fundamental class $[L] \in H_2$ representing any such line. To compute the self-intersection $[L] \cdot [L]$, choose two representatives $L$ and $L'$ which intersect transversely (in a point, by basic intersection theory); since $\CC \PP^1$ is canonically oriented as well, and the orientations of $L$ and $L'$ agree with that of $\CC \PP^2$ (since they are subspaces of $\CC \PP^2$), we have that $[L] \cdot [L] = 1$. 
\end{example}
\begin{example}
    In $S^2 \times S^2$, the second homology group is $\ZZ^2$, generated by $h = [S^2 \times \{x\}]$ and $v = [\{x\} \times S^2]$. $S^2 \times \{x\}$ and $\{x\} \times S^2$ intersect transversely at $(x,x)$, and, regarding $S^2$ with its canonical orientation as a complex manifold ($\CC \PP^1$), the orientations agree to give $h \cdot v = 1$. To compute $h \cdot h$, intersect representatives $S^2 \times \{x\}$ and $S^2 \times \{y\}$ for $x \neq y$, from which it is set-theoretically clear that $h^2 = 0$ (and similarly for $v$). Thus, the intersection form as a matrix in the basis $(h,v)$ can be written as $\begin{psmallmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{psmallmatrix}$ This intersection form is therefore \textit{even}, meaning that for any $k = ah+bv$, $k \cdot k = 2ab$ is even.
\end{example}
\end{twocol}
